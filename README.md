# robot_navigation_a_star

This repo is to solve a simple robot navigation problem.

A four wheeled robot wants to move from A to B and is allowed to move forward left(FL), forward straight(FS), froward  right(FR), backup left(BL), backup straight(BS) or backup right(BR).

orientation can be modeled as 0 = North, 1 = West, 2 = South, 3 = East

Below is a example of discretized map with black as obstacles and grey as one solution from A to B.
